Note that the Dataset files are shown in the VS Solution Explorer through "Visual Studio Links".
The actual folder holding the DatSets is placed at the same level than /src, so the datasets are separated from the source code.

This is the folder structure:

<your-local-repo-folder>/data
   ---Dataset files

<your-local-repo-folder>/models
   ---Generated trained model files

<your-local-repo-folder>/src
   ---Source code files
